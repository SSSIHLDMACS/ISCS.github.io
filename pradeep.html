<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p>
<div style="text-align:justify">
 NVIDIA GPUs are powering a revolution inÂ machine learning. With the rise of deep learning algorithms, in particular deep convolutional neural networks, computers are learning to see, hear, and understand the world around us in ways never before possible. Image recognition and detection systems are getting close to human-level performance. I will explain what deep learning is, and how deep learning enables scientists to automatically process image data. I will also introduce basics of GPU computing why they are good fit for Deep Neural networks. NVIDIA's recently released cuDNN library v3, DIGITS 2.0 and Depp learning education, I will try to cover all of them. This talk will help developers on how they can apply GPU based DL framework DIGITS to solve their own research problems and quickly start working on application.
