<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p>
<div style="text-align:justify">
 Computing is being transformed to a model consisting of services that are commoditised and delivered in a manner similar to utilities such as water, electricity, gas, and telephony. In such a model,users access services based on their requirements without regard to where the services are hosted. Several computing paradigms have  promised to deliver this utility computing vision. Cloud computing has emerged as one of the buzzwords in the IT industry and turned the vision of  "computing utilities" into a reality. Several IT vendors  have started offering computation, storage, and application hosting services, and provide coverage in several continents, supporting Service-Level Agreements (SLA) backed performance and uptime promises for their services. Clouds deliver infrastructure, platform, and software (application) as services, which are made available as subscription-based services in a pay-as-you-go model to consumers. The price that Cloud Service Providers charge can vary with time and the quality of service (QoS) expectations of consumers. This keynote presentation will cover (a) 21st century vision of computing and identifies various IT paradigms promising to deliver the vision of computing utilities; (b) opportunities and challenges for utility and market-oriented Cloud computing, (c) innovative architecture for creating market-oriented and elastic Clouds by harnessing  virtualisation technologies; (d) Aneka, a Cloud Application Platform, and Cloudbus Workflow Engine for rapid development of Cloud/Big Data applications and their deployment on private/public Clouds with resource  provisioning driven by SLAs; (e) experimental results on deploying Cloud and Big Data applications in engineering, and health care,astronomy/ satellite image processing on elastic Clouds,and (f) directions for delivering our 21st century vision along with pathways for future research.
