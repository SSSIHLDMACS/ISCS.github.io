<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p>
<div style="text-align:justify">
The cloud is well known for its elasticity by leveraging abundant resources. Cloud data centres easily host thousands or even millions of multicore servers. Further, these servers are increasingly virtualized for the sake of data centre efficiency. However, the reality is that these resources are often relentlessly exploited particularly to improve applications performance. Although the elasticity facilitates achieving cost efficiency (or the performance to cost ratio), the ultimate efficiency in resource usage (or more broadly data centres) lies in scheduling and resource allocation strategies that explicitly take into account actual resource consumption. The optimization of resource efficiency in clouds is of great practical importance considering its numerous benefits in the economic and environmental sustainability. In this talk, we will discuss resource efficiency in cloud data centres with an example of large-scale distributed processing applications including scientific workflows and MapReduce jobs.
