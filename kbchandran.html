<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p>
<div style="text-align:justify">
High performance computing capabilities has enabled the development of complex simulations of the functions of human organs to improve our understanding of the normal physiology, etiology and growth of diseases, and in the planning of treatment and surgical interventions. The four heart valves in the human heart provide a vital function in ensuring unidirectional blood flow with minimal resistance.  Diseases such as stenosis and incompetence result in the malfunctioning of the valves.   Treatment for patients with diseased valves include repair of the native valves to restore its function or replacement with artificial valves. Computational simulations are increasingly being used to assess the extent of the disease and the effectiveness of the valve repair techniques.  Simulations involve several steps: three-dimensional reconstruction of the complex geometry of the valves from imaging data employing image processing algorithms; development of highly efficient computational algorithms for the valve tissues, blood flow dynamics across the valve leaflets and the constant interaction between the solid structures and the fluid. The application of such simulations to analyze the mechanical alterations with congenital bicuspid aortic valves and the complex mitral valve dynamics will be presented.
