<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p>
<div style="text-align:justify">
Assignment Problems are fundamental to diverse branches of science and engineering. Some of their applications include information fusion, protein-protein interaction analysis, facility layout design, vehicle routing and resource scheduling. In this era of “big data” many of these applications demand solutions to very large instances of Assignment Problems in short amount of time. With a few exceptions, a vast majority of these Assignment Problems are NP-hard and many large instances are still not solved to provable optimality.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style="text-align:justify">
Our research proposes novel algorithms that harness the power of graphics cards present on desktop computers or large computational clusters to find exact solutions to massive and never-before-attempted instances of these fundamental Assignment Problems, and unlock new avenues for groundbreaking discoveries in various spheres of science and engineering.

<div style="text-align:justify">
In the first part, we describe a parallel version of the alternating tree Hungarian algorithm for solving the linear assignment problem (LAP). CUDA enabled NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU) is chosen as the parallel programming architecture because of its ability to perform intense computations on arrays and matrices. The main contribution of our research is an efficient parallelization of the augmenting path search phase of the Hungarian algorithm. Computational experiments on problems with up to 25 million variables reveal that our algorithm is on average 5-6 times faster than the sequential algorithm and the speedup increases with the problem size. A similar speedup is achieved for larger problems with up to 400 million variables, which are solved within 33 seconds on average. We also tested a multi-GPU version of the algorithm with up to 16 GPUs, which shows good scaling behavior for problems with up to 1.6 billion variables and dense cost matrix structure.

In the second part, we consider the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), which is strongly NP-hard problem and it cannot be solved efficiently within a guaranteed time limit. Additionally, it is difficult to find a provable -optimal solution to QAP. The quadratic nature of the objective function also adds to the solution complexity. One of the ways of solving the QAP is to convert it into a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) by introducing additional variables and constraints. Using the RLT2 linearization, we implement a dual ascent algorithm to find tight lower bounds and even solve many problems to optimality.
