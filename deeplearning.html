<p><b>Biography:</b>Pradeep Gupta is a Lead HPC & Deep Learning Solutions Architect at NVIDIA, where he supports customers and developers across Asia Pacific, Japan and India regions for Deep Learning and HPC application development. Pradeep also works to enable the GPU computing ecosystem in universities and research labs across region. Pradeep is also responsible for running and managing R&D Projects at NVIDIA Technology Centre at Singapore. He is working on smart cities enablement with GPU computing initiative in NVIDIA. Before joining NVIDIA, Pradeep had worked with various technologies in High Performance Computing domains. Pradeep received a Master's degree in research from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. </p>

<strong> Abstract</strong> <br>

<p>NVIDIA GPUs are powering a revolution in machine learning. With the rise of deep learning algorithms, in particular deep convolutional neural networks, computers are learning to see, hear, and understand the world around us in ways never before possible. Image recognition and detection systems are getting close to human-level performance. I will explain what deep learning is, and how deep learning enables scientists to automatically process image data. I will also introduce basics of GPU computing why they are good fit for Deep Neural networks. NVIDIA's recently released cuDNN library v3, DIGITS 2.0 and Depp learning education, I will try to cover all of them. This talk will help developers on how they can apply GPU based DL framework DIGITS to solve their own research problems and quickly start working on application.</p>
