<strong> Abstract</strong> <br>
<p> Graph algorithms have been at the forefront of computing research because of their immense applications to various diverse fields from sciences and engineering. The advent of parallelism and modern computer architectures in the past decade furthered the interest in graph algorithms that are also practically efficient. Several approaches and algorithms are designed for various problems such as connected components, shortest paths, betweenness centrality, subgraph identification, and the like. In most of these cases, algorithmic implications of certain structural properties of real world graphs are used to improve the behaviour of the algorithm on such graphs. </p>
<p>In this talk, we will briefly study some of the structural properties of real-world graphs. This is followed by understanding the implications of such properties on algorithms, especially in the parallel setting. We will use case studies such as biconnected components, shortest paths, and the like. The talk will review some of the recent developments on these problems. The talk ends with exciting future possibilities in this broad area. </p>
