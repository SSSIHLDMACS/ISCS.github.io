<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p>
<div style="text-align:justify">
This talk will focus on challenges in designing HPC and Big Data middleware for Exascale systems with millions of processors and accelerators.  For the HPC domain, we will discuss about the challenges in designing runtime environments for MPI+X (PGAS -
OpenSHMEM/UPC/CAF, OpenMP, and CUDA) programming models by taking into account support for multi-/many-core, high-performance networks, GPGPUs, Intel MICs and Virtualization. Energy-aware designs and co-design schemes for such environments will also be emphasized. Features and sample performance numbers from MVAPICH2 libraries will be presented.  For the Big Data domain, we will focus on high-performance and scalable designs of Hadoop (including HDFS, MapReduce, RPC, and HBase), Spark, and Memcached using native RDMA support for InfiniBand and RoCE. Finally, designs to utilize HPC clusters with Parallel File Systems (such as Lustre) for Big Data applications will be presented.

<strong><u> DK Panda </u></strong> is a Professor and University Distinguished Scholar of Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University.  He has published over 350 papers in the area of high-end computing and networking.  The MVAPICH2 (High Performance MPI and PGAS over InfiniBand, iWARP and RoCE) libraries, designed and developed by his research group (http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu), are currently being used by more than 2,500 organizations worldwide (in 76 countries). More than 310,000 downloads of this software have taken place from the project's site. This software is empowering several InfiniBand clusters (including the 10th, 13th and 25th ranked ones) in the TOP500 list. The RDMA libraries for Apache Hadoop and Memcached together with OSU HiBD benchmarks from his group (http://hibd.cse.ohio-state.edu) are also publicly available.  These
libraries are currently being used by more than 135 organizations in 20 countries. More than 13,000 downloads of these libraries have taken place. He is an IEEE Fellow.
